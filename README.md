# Python Data Visualization Project

This project was developed as part of a university course, aiming to demonstrate how to effectively extract and visualize insights from data using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

ðŸ§  Project Overview
The notebook showcases:
- Loading and preprocessing datasets
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visual representation of trends, patterns, and correlations
- Summary statistics and interpretations
The goal was to explore how much information we can derive from raw data using widely available Python tools.

The primary aim is to show how raw datasets can be transformed into meaningful insights and visuals, helping users understand their data better. Itâ€™s also a learning tool for students or beginners interested in data science and analytics.
